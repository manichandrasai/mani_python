# Given a string, return a list containing the characters of the string. If a character in the string is a space or a digit greater than 5, remove them and do not include them in the array. Note: the initial code in the editor uses tabs for indentation. Don't mix it with spaces. 
# Examples: 
# 	Input: "my string" 
# 	Output: ["m","y","s","t","r","i","n","g"] 
# 	Input: "5 dollar" 
# 	Output: ["5","d","o","l","l","a","r"] 
# 	Input: "6 cents" 
# 	Output: ["c","e","n","t","s"]
